# 📚 C Recursion Project

## ✨ Description

This project explores the concepts of **recursion** in C through a series of functions that demonstrate its use in various contexts. Each function is designed to solve a specific problem, ranging from printing strings to determining if a number is prime.

## 🛠️ Implemented Functions

Here are the functions you'll find in this project:

1. **`_puts_recursion`**: Prints a string followed by a new line.
2. **`_print_rev_recursion`**: Prints a string in reverse.
3. **`_strlen_recursion`**: Returns the length of a string.
4. **`factorial`**: Returns the factorial of a given number.
5. **`_pow_recursion`**: Returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
6. **`_sqrt_recursion`**: Returns the natural square root of a number.
7. **`is_prime_number`**: Determines if an integer is a prime number.
